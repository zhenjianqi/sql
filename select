Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.


select a.name, a.continent 
from world  as a 
where a.population/3 > all (
 select b.population  
 from world as b 
 where  a.continent = b.continent and a.name != b.name 
);




Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

select name,continent,population from world   where continent in (
   select continent from world  a  where 25000000 >= (select max(population)  from world  b where b.continent = a.continent)
);



SELECT y.name, y.continent, y.population
FROM world AS y
JOIN
(select continent,max(population) 
from world  
group by continent 
HAVING max(population) <= 25000000 ) AS x
 ON  x.continent = y.continent;




Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area:

SELECT continent,name,area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND y.area>0 )  order by continent,area desc;
